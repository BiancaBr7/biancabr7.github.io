                <p>Hi! My name is Bianca Bai. <br>(My legal name is Xiuqi Bai, but I prefer to be called as Bianca.)</p>
        
                <p>I am currently a first-year student in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/future-students/software-engineering" target="_blank">Software Engineering program at the University of Waterloo</a>. I have completed two <a href="experience" target="_blank">internships</a> and participated in other <a href="hs" target="_blank">extracurricular activities</a>, which have provided me with valuable experiences. </p>

                <p>Here are some <a href="projects" target="_blank">projects</a> I've made.</p>
        
                <p>I am particularly interested in problem-solving and am a fast learner with a keen interest in acquiring new knowledge. I am detail-oriented, determined, and passionate about both my work and study. My greatest strength is my caring and compassionate personality, which allows me to excel in leadership roles where I can make a positive impact.</p>
        
                <p>I have been engaged in the field of programming for nearly six years. I am proficient in the following programming languages and tools:</p>
