                <p>Hi! My name is Bianca Bai. <br>(My legal name is Xiuqi Bai, but I prefered to be called as Bianca.)</p>
        
                <p>I came to study in Canada in 2022. I am currently a Gr. 12 international student at Iroquois Ridge High School. Even though I'm a bit of a newbie to the American/Canadian education system, I have enrolled in a variety of <a href="experience" target="_blank">extracurricular activities</a>, during which I gained valuable experiences. </p>
        
                <p>Growing up, I am that bright kid everyone said I was. I mean... it does make sense: I am a fast learner, always determined to do stuff well once I started... But I feel like my biggest strength is my caring and compassionate personality. I enjoy being a leader to make a difference! </p>
        
                <p>STEM and problem solving is my jam! I've been fascinated by it since like forever. In Grade 8, I started learning to program, and that's when I discovered my particular interest in Computer Science    . I know the following programming language/tools:</p>
