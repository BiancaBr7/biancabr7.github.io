        <p>Hi! My name is Bianca Bai. <br>(My legal name is Xiuqi Bai, but I prefered to be called as Bianca.)</p>

        <p>I came to study in Canada in 2022. I am currently a Gr. 12 international student at Iroquois Ridge High School. Even though I'm a bit of a newbie to the American education system, I have enrolled in a variety of <a href="experience.html">activities</a>, during which I gained valuable experiences. </p>

        <p>Growing up, I am that bright kid everyone said I was. I mean... it does make sense: I am a fast learner, always determined to do stuff well once I started... But I feel like my biggest strength is my caring and compassionate personality. I enjoy being a leader to make a difference! </p>

        <p>STEM and problem solving is my jam! I've been fascinated by it since forever. In 8th grade, I started learning to program, and that's when I discovered my particular interest in Computer Science. I know the following programming language/tools:
            <br>Python: since Feb.2020
            <br>C++: since Jun.2021
            <br>HTML: since Jun.2023
            <br>Godot Game Engine: since Jun.2023   
        <br>Here are some <a href="projects.html">projects</a> I've made.
        <br>You may also want to check some of the contests I've participated in. 
        </p>
        
        <p>I am also a very <em>artistic</em> type of person! I enjoy painting, playing music, designing and 3D modeling. Check some of my <a href="hobbies.html">work</a> here!</p>

        <p>I'd love to get to know you!!! Please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me!</p>
